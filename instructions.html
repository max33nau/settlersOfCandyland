  <p> 1. Understand the goal of the game. The object of Settlers of Candyland is to be the first to gain 10 victory points. Points are earned by placing desserts, buying cards, and earning accomplishment cards such as "Longest Churro" and "Largest Pancake".
    Each cupcake is worth one victory point and each ice cream sundae is worth two victory points.
    Each "Victory Point" card is worth one victory point.
    Each special card is worth two victory points. The "Longest Churro" card will be awarded to the first person to successfully place a continuous five Churros. The card will switch hands whenever a player's number of connecting churros surpasses the longest continuous churros of the cardholder. The "Largest pancake" card will be awarded to the first person to play three "pancake" cards. The card will switch hands whenever a player plays more "pancake" cards than the "Largest Pancake" cardholder.

      2. Place the first cupcakes. The first player places one of their settlements at an intersection, where three tile hexes meet, the adjoining hexes are the ingredients they will earn if the number on that hex is rolled (so choose wisely!). Next, they place one of their churros on one of the three possible places next to their first settlement. The next player then takes their turn in the same way, but must place their cupcakes in a different area.
      churros must always be placed where two hexes meet and border the player's cupcake.
      A cupcake cannot be placed on an intersection adjacent to another intersection occupied by a cupcake. There must be enough space for at least two churros between each cupcake.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. Place the final cupcakes. The last player gets to place two cupcakes and two churros (one for each cupcake) and then going counter-clockwise, the first players place their second cupcake and second churro until each player has two cupcakes and two churros down on the board.
    </p>

    <p>
      4.  Get your first dessert cards. After all players have placed both of their cupcakes and churros, you all get some dessert cards to start. Take one dessert card for each hex tile that is adjacent to each of your two cupcakes.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      5.  Roll the dice. Each player's cupcake will be touching three hexes with three numbers. If the number that is rolled corresponds to the number that a player's cupcake is on, then that player gets to pick up a dessert card of that hex. The same is true for a player with a ice cream sundae (instead of a cupcake), except that they would get to pick up two dessert cards.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      6.  Take your turn actions. After the dice are rolled, the player then has the option of either placing churros or upgrading cupcakes to ice cream sundaes, playing a dessert card, or trading. Players may choose to do all or none of these actions. When a player has finished taking his or her actions, the next player to the right can roll the dice.

      You may only play one dessert card per turn.
